        <h2> A little about me</h2>
        <p>My full name is actually Maisarah Diyanah Mahathir. Pretty long in its nature so I just go by Mai. I am from Malaysia, but am currently residing in the US as I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying Psychology and User Experience. My hobbies include cooking/baking, reading, running, boxing and recently gaming!
            I started this website because I wanted a place where I could not only document my recipes and food that I enjoy, but also a place to run my small business, Mai Bakes! I first started Mai Bakes during the pandemic last year.
           I have always had a passion for baking, and quarantining during the pandemic gave me the time to explore my capabilities and strengths as a baker. I started making new things, experimenting new recipes and exploring different kinds of baked goods that I could potentially make. After a while, all I wanted to do was share what I was making with the community, in hopes of bringing light and joy amidst those dark times through my baked goods.

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>Apart from my day-to-day hobbies, I also do a whole lot of travelling when I have the time. I have travelled to many different countries such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, UK, and of course the US.
             In the summer of 2021, I travelled to 13 different states within the US itself! I love and appreciate both nature and the city, so travelling anywhere and everywhere is good for me. However, I have to say that my favorite state in the US so far has been Colorado, as it has a little bit of everything. If I'm in need of some exposure to nature, I could go to the Rockies or the other national parks or waterfalls in Colorado. If I'm looking for a night out in the city, I could always go to Denver and spend time in one of their many aesthetically-pleasing bars. No matter what geography you want to surround yourself with, Colorado has it in abundance. 

            Here are some snippets of a few of my travels:
