        <p>My full name is Maisarah Diyanah Mahathir, but everyone calls me Mai. I am from Malaysia, but am currently residing in the US as I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying Psychology and UX. My hobbies include cooking/baking, reading, running, boxing and travelling!
            I started this website because I wanted a place where I could not only document my recipes and food that I enjoy, but also run my small business, Mai Bakes! </p>
            <p tabindex="0">I first started Mai Bakes during the pandemic last year.
           I have always had a passion for baking, and quarantining during the pandemic gave me the time to explore my capabilities and strengths as a baker. I started making new things, experimenting new recipes and exploring different kinds of baked goods that I could potentially make. After a while, all I wanted to do was share what I was making with the community, in hopes of bringing light and joy amidst those dark times through my baked goods.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am currently about to graduate from the University of Michigan (UMich) with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Throughout my undergraduate career, I was mostly interested in the areas of organizational and developmental psychology. Having those interests, I pursued two internships where I did change management, one at PLUS Malaysia Berhad in the year 2019 and the other at the National Bank of Malaysia (BNM) in 2020. In both internships, I was involved in tasks such as data analysis, conducting interviews, conducting research and planning and developing change management plans for the company. 
        </p>
        <p tabindex = '0'>However, my interests now lie on the intersection between psychology and tech, specifically in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX). 

            In the year 2020, I got into the School of Information at UMich and started to take classes related to these two fields, immediately finding a passion for user research and designing user-centered systems/products that make our lives easier as humans. I also have experience in web programming, usability testing, accessibility evaluation, conducting user interviews, and using UX software such as Figma and Adobe XD. My interest in HCI stemmed from my participation in a research project with Dr. Robin Brewer, a professor here at the university. For our research, we studied the different types of media content on the perceptions and attitudes towards dementia among college students. You can read the published paper linked in the 'My Projects' section of this page. As for my future plans, I intend to pursue a master's degree in HCI after working a few years in the UX team at PETRONAS, the national oil and gas company of Malaysia.

        <h2> My cat Koko</h2>
        <p>	Meet the love of my life, Koko! How I met her is a very interesting story. 
            One night, I was driving back from a friend's house when I saw an animal that looked like a rat on the road upfront. I was almost going to run over it but I realized it was not a rat, but a small kitten who was scared and lonely. I stopped the car, ran to where I saw her and took her home. She was bleeding everywhere, so I cleaned her and gave her milk. When I took her to the vet, they said that it was unlikely that she will survive without her mother. I then found out that she had a broken leg that caused her to limp when she walked. I made the decision to take on the responsibility of caring for her. I spent hundreds on her food and medicine for her leg and her diarrhea, woke up at night every 4 hours to feed her and gave her warmth and attention 24/7.
        </p>
        <p tabindex = "0"> Now, Koko is happily living her life back at my house in Kuala Lumpur. Her leg has fully healed, she is more than healthy (as you can see from how big she is now), and lives a very luxurious life! She is loved by everyone in the house, including my grandparents. 
             I haven't seen Koko in so long, and I can't wait for her to be back in my arms again.
