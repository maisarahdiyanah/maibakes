    <p>For now, I am only selling my strawberry cheesecake (sold by the slice and by whole cake) and banana cake (sold by the loaf and by whole cake). 
    These are homemade recipes that I managed to ask my grandmother for, and I am so excited for you to try these delicious goods! More items coming soon!</p>
    
    <h2> Strawberry Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>I kid you not when I say that my grandfather tells me to make this for him every week! It has the perfect creamy texture and tastes fresh and not to sweet! Our homemade strawberry sauce also has a good balance of sweet and sour.</p>

    <h2> Banana Cake</h2>
    <p>This one's a family favorite! This banana cake will definitely satisfy anyone from all age groups. It's my grandma's secret family recipe and I'm so glad that I have the opportunity to share it with all of you.</p>
